Hello everyone today I want to talk about how did I improve my self.
When I was in the preparation class, I had met a friend. His name was Cagatay. 
He said to me that there is an opening of Hackerspace at Teknokent, and ask me that would I like to come.
I had accepted and gone to the opening. After the opening, we had talked about software programming and he tells me I should come here to learn how to program, and maybe we can code together. But I was scared. Because I did not know
almost anything about programming just a lit bit. But I had studied on my own. After we got to the first-class of our department
the teachers had taught us somethings that I learned in two weeks, for the whole period. That was pretty shameful for me because I was
waiting for many things. After a while, Cagatay and 2 other his friends were making a website. I had felt so bad because I still didn't know anything about websites. But I didn't stop there. I like the competition. I always try to catch them and now 
I'm pretty good at my job thanks to them. If I had not met them probably I could not be here now. If you have friends which they are good at their job,  you should define them as the opponent to race them and improve yourself. But that's not mean make 
them your enemy. Competition and racing will bring improvement.
